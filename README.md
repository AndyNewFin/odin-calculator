2) Draft up a calculator design
	a) Numeric buttons 0 through 9
	b) Operator buttons: Add | Subtract | Multiply | Divide
	c) Equal button
	d) Clear button
	e) Calculator screen that displays pressed button then results


3) Write some Pseudocode

Finished the calculator project and got as far as I can with my own research and the help from Reddit and Discord

This project was way more difficult then I expected it to be. Everything seemed intuitive when I was writing out the pseudocode, but the code that needed to be written out was harder to implement

Some issues I had were:
1) Assigning the numeric values to the buttons
2) Assign arithmetic operators to the buttons

After I solved the above issues, the problems I had that I was unable to solve were:
1) Getting the button input to "save" and "wait" as I entered the operator and second number
2) Getting a number or operator to appear in the "Display"
	2a) I was able to solve arithmetic for 2 numbers via message box and console log

I worked on this project for about 3-4 days before I was unable to continue, even with the help of the community.
I watched Jaybees Tech Talk calculator tutorials to help complete this project:

I am happy that I completed on my own:
HTML: 95% (5% from Jay bees: I had to enter additional "button" codes)
CSS: 100%
JS: 50% (full disclosure: I completly scrapped my original JS code since it did NOT work with Jay bees)
